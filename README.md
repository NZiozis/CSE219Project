This gitlab stores all the of my cse 219 homeworks and recitations. When you are trying to run an
application please make sure that you are in the correct directory to run it. For instance, if you
are trying to test hw1, the project should be opened at the hw1 directory level, not at the Homework
directory level. This can be done by cloning the repo and then opening the project at the
appropriate level. The same should be done for the recitations if you were to access them for some reason.
